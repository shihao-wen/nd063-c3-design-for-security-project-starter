# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty detected the SSHBruteForce attack and mark it as both high severity and low severity (Regarding different istances).

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
This finding’s severity is low if a brute force attack is aimed at one of your EC2 instances. This finding’s severity is high if your EC2 instance is being used to perform the brute force attack.
For low severity findings, Credentials that were created exclusively for an EC2 instance through an instance launch role are being used from an external IP address.
For high severity findsing, An unusual console login by a principal in your AWS account was observed.
This finding is triggered when a console login is detected under suspicious circumstances. For example, if a principal with no prior history of doing so, invoked the ConsoleLogin API from a never-before-used client or an unusual location. This could be an indication of stolen credentials being used to gain access to your AWS account, or a valid user accessing the account in an invalid or less secure manner (for example, not over an approved VPN).
