Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Neither public nor private bucket have bucket policy attached to it.
From the best practice, we need to have S3 buket policy to restrict and control access.

# Poor practice 2
Need to apply least preivilege IAM policy.
For example, we can apply deny effect to our private bucket.
And set specific action to be approved or denied by certain bucket.
